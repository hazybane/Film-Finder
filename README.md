# Film-Finder

This is a basic film finder app built using React and TMDB API. Users can search for films by title and get information about each film including the title, release year, genre, and plot summary.

# Usage

To search for a film, simply enter the title into the search bar. The app will retrieve a list of films that match the search query and display them in a list. Mouse entering on a film will display more information about the film including the title, release year,genre and plot summary.
